Effective Communication & day to day conversation is essential to building and maintaining a good relationships in the workplace. Communication is the creation or exchange of thoughts, ideas, emotions, and understanding between the two people or group of people. 
Employers that invest time and energy into establishing clear methods of communication build trust among employees. Strong trust between employees and employers leads to increased morale and overall productivity. Teams work together more efficiently and managers are more transparent about upcoming changes that impact their teams. Instead of working their way through the chain of command, when an employee needs an issue addressed, they send a direct message to the appropriate party, gaining a fast response.
This list outlines some of the most common communication problems in the workplace along with how to address them:
•	Cultural differences
•	Attitude
•	Lack of motivation
•	Listening skills
•	Written communication quality
•	Appropriate communication tools
•	Oversharing
So it’s important to understand why as a society we have created this fear to speak up. Especially, in the group of peers or co-workers. Isn’t it amazing if we can speak our mind out and say to our boss that the project deadline which is put out there is completely unreasonable and think about telling our co-workers that they are really difficult to reach out to them. 
Some of us might be really lucky enough to work in such a kind of environment which values such conversations & encourages employees to share their inner feeling without filters with openness and honesty. However, in many places it is not the norm. We can find many people who are afraid to speak up and afraid to have honest conversations out in the open especially when needed the most. For example, when you are in a meeting and have an idea but not everyone agrees and no one says a word or gives any sort of feedback and after sometime it might so happen that the participants starts looking at the cell phone and begins to send sms or browse something on the internet in same meeting indicating how stupid the idea is. And there will be some kind of people who starts talking immediately and starts discussing about the meeting after it is over and offers all kinds of opinions about the meeting or an idea which was discussed in the meeting.  But the problem here is it is after the meeting and not during the meeting which might have changed the course of discussion or have had a better idea. Its important to bring these ideas or discussions in the meeting rather than bringing it up after the meeting which will not have any impact. If we open a conversation during the meeting if the idea was great then we will become more productive, less fearful and even happier at work. Often, many people ask how to have such conversations especially when we are not in leadership position or we are working at a place where they don’t value that kind of approach and honesty. To be very frank, it comes out due to four important things such as:
1.	Confidence
2.	Intent
3.	Delivery
4.	Solution

Let’s go in details about each one of these aspects which helps to make impactful conservations at our workplace. 
1.	Confidence:
 
	It is easier said than done. However, I have some little trick which might helps you. Next time when you are in a meeting and want to speak out but still you are nervous or anxious, I strongly recommend you to use “Captain Obvious Strategy”. Call me Captain obvious but isn’t that solution not really going to address our problem out there. By saying Captain Obvious, it basically adds little humour to the moment and the confidence you show might help others who are having same opinion of yours might start to pick up and add some points of their own and by doing this, you open up a lot of possibilities for effective discussion on the subject matter. Every time it is not required to say Captain Obvious loudly, you can say it quietly on your head before you start conversation or want some boosting before you start to speak. So confidence is the first step in all of this.  

2.	Intent:
 
Intent is about the purpose and a reason to speak up. It is about knowing and understanding that by me speaking up are we going to work about the problem or address a situation. For example, when someone is really difficult in the meeting and I say to them about it, my intent is not to embarrass them. My intent is to make them aware about their behaviour which is impacting the group. It’s important to go with positive intent & open mind which makes our message to receive at other end effectively.

3.	Delivery: 
Delivery is about how you frame the actual message. It needs to be factual & real. When we say real, it means there is no hiding out any information which is useful and nothing to just impress someone in the meeting. It should always take receivers feeling into account. For example, if you are working in a team, and there is a member who doesn’t contribute much with their presence and add value to the team and everyone knows about it but still no one is courageous enough to point that out to him in a larger group setting but people talk about him almost every day. Then after several weeks of expressing a complaint in a bad way & after severe loss in productivity, you have to find a side to have a conversation along with the larger group. So its important to deliver the message in a proper way. Our conversation with the team should be like, “hey Team, we haven’t met any of our commitments in the last several weeks. Hey, team member, we have looked at the data and the past records and we have realised that you have not been contributing anything and failing to meet your commitments. We have to take receiver’s feeling into account and must take his confidence while highlighting his weakness. We have to tell like, we are concerned that, you don’t have everything you need and we needed to do something better to support you”. These types of conversations works most of the times which shows empathy towards co-workers. It creates more confidence to the team to speak up. So with such instances, the teams might be best performing teams when they try to express themselves and given the platform and confidence to do it. This will surely help not just the individuals but also helps the company to excel just by having such type of conversations. 
 
4.	Solution:
The last and final tip is about the solution. We should always enter the conversation with the mindset of seeking a feasible solution. It is the one which is missing the most in many occasions. In most cases, we find ourselves in a situation where we enter the meeting and discuss a lot about the problem the whole day or whole duration of the meeting and we come to the end of the meeting, we realize we have short of time and leave the discussion without having a proper solution which is mostly required. For example, when we are in a project, we know the problem which we face in a day to day situation at the site and we call someone from the ground who can explain the things better but the person with whome we are planning to have conversation should come with solutions in mind rather than exaggerating the problems which are already making things worse. Having some ideas about the solutions will create the space to work with options. Possible solutions always creates possible options. It’s easier said that done, its important to change our thinking. 9 out of 10 times, if one person is thinking it then one other person in the room might have the same thought and the beauty is once it is said, the real conversation sets to begin and other people might come up with different solutions which maybe much practical and easy to implement. 
 

Summary:
•	The best organisations are full of people at all levels with such kind of people who can tackle through the tough topics.
•	Being open and honest, we are not just helping ourselves but also our company to perform better. 
•	An effective conservation should come with confidence, intent, delivery and solution mindset to make an impact at the workplace.
